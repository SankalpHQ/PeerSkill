# PeerSkill

PeerSkill is a peer-to-peer skill sharing platform that connects students, professionals, and hobbyists who want to *learn, **teach, or **exchange* skills with each other.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Weâ€™re Solving
Traditional learning platforms are one-sided (teacher â†’ student) and expensive.  
PeerSkill solves this by enabling *mutual learning* and *knowledge barter* â€” making learning affordable, collaborative, and community-driven.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. *Create a Profile* â€“ Add skills you can offer and skills youâ€™re seeking.
2. *Match* â€“ Get matched with peers based on skill needs.
3. *Connect & Learn* â€“ Schedule 1-on-1 sessions or join group workshops.
4. *Rate & Review* â€“ Give feedback after sessions to improve the ecosystem.
